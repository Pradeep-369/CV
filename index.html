When We add JavaScript to Our Html Document Insome Poins The Script is loaded or Rendered Before Our HTML File This Cause an Unexpected Error 
this Type Of Problem Is Solved by some Techniqueies 
Those are : 
1. Add defer or async Attribute into the Script tag ;
2. Add the Javascript Code At the Bottom Of the Page Or Body ;
3. add The javascript Event Listener Tech 
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {
  ...
});


Async : => Scripts loaded using the async attribute (see below) will download the script without 
blocking rendering the page and will execute it as soon as the script finishes downloading
Eg: 
<script async src="js/vendor/jquery.js"></script>
async should be used when you have a bunch of background scripts to load in
, and you just want to get them in place as soon as possible.

Async is download and save the file in anyorder No matter what the order of the file you said in the code 



Defer: =>
Scripts loaded using the defer attribute (see below) will run in the order they 
appear in the page and execute them as soon as the script and content are downloaded:


Eg:  
<script defer src="js/vendor/jquery.js"></script>

<script defer src="js/script2.js"></script>

<script defer src="js/script3.js"></script>

All the scripts with the defer attribute will load in the order they appear on the page.



Summary: 

async and defer both instruct the browser to download the script(s) in a separate thread, 
while the rest of the page (the DOM, etc.) 
is downloading, so the page loading is not blocked by the scripts.
If your scripts should be run immediately and they don't have any dependencies, then use async.
If your scripts need to wait for parsing and depend on other scripts and/or the DOM being in place, 
load them using defer and put their corresponding <script> elements in the order you want the browser 
  to execute them.
